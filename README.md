# NagiORM
**Seishiro Nagi ORM*  is a personal learning project aimed at understanding the internal workings of Hibernate and Java Persistence API (JPA). This mini ORM is a simplified version built from scratch to explore how ORMs map Java objects to relational database tables and facilitate database operations.
