# MiniORM-Java: Proof of Concept

**Seishiro Nagi ORM** is a personal learning project aimed at understanding the internal workings of Hibernate and Java Persistence API (JPA). This mini ORM is a simplified version built from scratch to explore how ORMs map Java objects to relational database tables and facilitate database operations.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to:
- Gain a deeper understanding of how Hibernate and JPA work under the hood.
- Explore Java's Reflection API, annotation processing, and dynamic SQL generation.
- Learn the basics of managing database connections, transactions, and object persistence.

## Features

- [ ] **Basic main.java.Annotation Mapping**: Custom annotations to mark classes as entities and map fields to database columns.
- [ ] **Simplified CRUD Operations**: Implement core functionalities for inserting, retrieving, updating, and deleting records.
- [ ] **Reflection-based Mapping**: Use Java Reflection to parse annotations and link classes to database tables.
- [ ] **Dynamic SQL Construction**: Generate SQL queries based on Java class structures.
- [ ] **Connection Pooling**: Efficient management of database connections.
- [ ] **Transaction Management**: Basic transaction support to ensure data consistency.
- [ ] **Customizable main.java.Configuration**: Easily adaptable for different database schemas.
